## I. OVERVIEW

## II. CONTEXT

The goal of this software design document is to outline a capstone
project proposal in the Music Major at Stanford University, with a
concentration in Human Computer Interaction. I have always found
myself stretched between a desire to practice medicine, and a passion
for playing music. It seemed that neither interest would allow the
other to dominate.

A requirement for graduation with a Bachelor's of Arts in Music at
Stanford University is the **capstone project**. This is defined
as the _"culmination of the 16 units of coursework in your focus area."_
Though the core of the department focuses on a traditional music education
with classes in music history, ear training, and music theory, the
concentration allows for interdisciplinary exploration. I have chosen to
design my own concentration: **Human Computer Interaction**. The culmination
of my concentration has focused an interdisciplinary application of music to
the domain of neuroscience, audiovisual design, and computer generated sound
processing and synthesis. Therefore, my **proposal for a capstone project is the
development of artful biosignal sonification software**.

### i. GOALS

The goals for this project are as follows:

- Artful biosignal sonification software
- Implementation of playback and livestream mode:
  - Playback mode would allow a complete dataset to be played through the
    sonification algorithm to generate an output file.
  - Livestream implements a direct pipeline from hardware sensors to biosignal
    aquisition, digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms, to sound synthesis in
    an instantaneous format.
  - Ultimately, a audiovisual exhibit to **artfully** represent human vitals in
    the domain of music.
